# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, we aim to apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the Heart Disease dataset in order to mine and classify the data effectively. Support Vector Machines find the optimal hyperplane to separate classes within the dataset, which in this case is identifying the presence or absence of heart disease.
