## 📘 About the Project

This project applies **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to the Heart Disease dataset for the classification of patients into two categories: "No Disease" and "Disease." The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying heart disease cases based on clinical and demographic variables.

### 🔑 Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling for effective SVM implementation.
2. **Classification Models**:
   - Developed models using linear and radial kernels.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimized SVM parameters using grid search and cross-validation for better classification accuracy.
4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and ROC curves.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Best Model**: The tuned SVM with a radial kernel achieved:
  - **Accuracy**: 99.03%
  - **Sensitivity (Recall)**: 100%
  - **Specificity**: 97.93%
  - **Precision**: 98.19%
- **Clinical Impact**:
  - High sensitivity ensures no cases of heart disease are missed.
  - Robust predictions make the model suitable for deployment in medical diagnostics.
